Allora...Hey,I'm Markdown.:bowtie:

Wait, ~~strike that~~..this needs to be a heading which we can create using a `#`

# Why hello, Markdown :smiley:
###### (psst...I hear you're easy)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Markdown is fun (and easy)! It lets you format text and makes your documents look pretty by using *italicised* or **bold** words, for example. You can also create a link such as this one which takes you to [my GitHub page](https://github.com/nair-r) :wink:

If you are person who likes making lists, you can do that:
1. one
2. two
3. three

or , forget numbers (because really everything you have to say is equally important :laughing:) and instead you can make bulleted lists:
* this is important
* this is also important
  * and this is how you nest all the important things you have to say.
  
Ahhh but making lists is one thing, and getting through them is another. So let's make a task list and check all those items off one by one!

- [x] Create a Markdown doc - done!
- [x] Fill it with silly (but useful, usefully silly?) stuff - done!
- [ ] At some point in the doc, insert a furry animal. :grinning:

Speaking of staying organized, (_and making things visually appealing_) let's not forget tables:

Table Header1 | Table Header2
--------------|---------------
first col| second col
second row, first col| second row, second col
third row, first col| third row, second col

(*you get the idea...*)

So, this was fun! To learn more of Markdown's cool syntax, [check out this page](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)! 

And finally, if you like cute furry animals(*who doesn't!*), you can embed pics of them, like this pic of a :smile_cat: learning Markdown_(*remember to check that last item off my task-list!*)
